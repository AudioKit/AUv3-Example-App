/*
This file contains the code for a horizontal MIDI sequencer view, similar to what you see
in most Digital Audio Workstations.
To add this view to your app, it's as simple as specifying the size/position of the view you
would like, giving it a MIDI File URL and track number, populating the view with notes,
adding the track to a parent view and playing the track!

For example:

var trackView1: AKMIDITrackView = AKMIDITrackView(frame: CGRect(x: , y: , width: , height: ),
midiFile: AKMIDIFile(url: urltoyourmidifile),
trackNumber: The MIDI track number you want to display)

//Inside View Controller

self.trackView1.populateViewNotes()

self.view.addSubview(self.trackView1)

self.trackView1.play()

If you are using an AKAppleSampler or AKSampler, sequencer, etc,
you will want to play the track directly before you play through the sequencer
so the sound is synced with the playback.

This file is still in development. I have tried loading some forms of MIDI files, and they do not yet work.
I also have not set up the playback to be synced with automated tempos which change over time.
I am hoping to achieve this soon by using AudioKit's AKMIDITempoListener.
